Generator costs and info were updated to published Black & Veatch source.

The data structure was changed, with overnight, fixed, and variable costs now defined by year rather than with a cost declination rate.

Several new tables were introduced, including generator_info_v2, generator_costs_5yearly, generator_costs_yearly, _proposed_projects_v2, existing_plants_v2, and fuel_info_v2. The old tables (generator_info, _proposed_projects, fuel_info) are retained to ensure older versions of the code can still be run.

Generator assumption scenarios will be handled differently via the generator_costs_scenarios and generator_info_scenarios tables. The old cost calculation approach with present day overnight cost and cost declination rate over time will have generator_assumption_scenario_id = 1 and generator_info_scenario_id = 1. Refer to generator_price_scenarios and generator_price_adjuster tables. These two are now obsolete, but for backwards compatibility will remain in place.

Baseline assumptions for the new cost calculation approach with overnight, fixed, and variable costs by year (also baseline heat rates and other generator input parameters) will have generator_costs_scenario_id = 2 in the generator_costs_yearly and generator_costs_5yearly tables. Baseline assumptions for parameters other than costs will have generator_info_scenario_id = 2 in the generator_info_v2 table.

A scenarios_v3 table was created, with the generator_price_scenario_id column removed. Two new columns were added: generator_costs_scenario_id and generator_info_scenario_id. Scenarios IDs in this table start at 3001 to avoid overlap with older scenarios.

We recreated the _proposed_projects_v2 table from _proposed_projects to ensure that the project ids remain matched. CPV projects were deleted.
